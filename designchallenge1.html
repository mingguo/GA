<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?
</h1>

<p>
1. <a href = "chilli.be"> chilli.be </a> <br />
2. <a href = "sharondaddihair.com"> sharondaddihair.com </a>
</p>

<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?
</h1>

<p>
<a href = "chilli.be"> chilli.be </a> <br />
What attracts me about this website is its elegant appearance. Left upper corner box effectively emphasize the business of the website. The color scheme is neutral and the background and various blocks coordinate well together. 
Use grid layout and equal size columns to ease visual effect. Spacing between columns is nicely spread out so that it doesn’t feel crowded. The different length of each block make it more artistic.
</p>

<p>
<a href = "sharondaddihair.com"> sharondaddihair.com </a> <br />
This website fully utilized the background effect to place viewers’ focus on the homepage and distinguish the different content areas in the website. The flow is very smooth without any confusion. The entrance to the website is so elegant and unique. 
Use one or two-column grid to convey simplistic and elegant style.
</p>

<h1>What makes them similar and different?
</h1>

<p>
Both sites are simple and elegant. <br />
The <a href = "sharondaddihair.com"> sharondaddihair.com </a> site is more brave and artistic in design. The <a href = "chilli.be"> chilli.be </a> site, on the other hand, conveys more variety of information. <br />
Both sites flow every easily, and are visually very plesant in the use of color scheme and flow of information.

<li><strong>Home Page </strong> <br />

<p> This site put the focal point on the center image which is dynamically linked to the user's location. The image will show health sensor data from wearble devices at an aggregate level. Background is subdued to suppor the focal point. No more hierachy at this homepage.
</p>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong> <br />

</li> 

<p> This site is a dashboard rendered based on cached data. The data source will be filtered by the locality and time range that the user choose. Focal point is the image, and sidebar is smaller in size to support the emphasis of center image.
Grey background improves the balance of the page.
